# Orange
TypeScript IoC container, dependency injection and basic MVVM framework.  

Orange comes compiled and ready just include the *orange.js* file in your html 
and somehow refer to the *orange.d.ts* file in your typescript source and you are 
ready to go. 

### Start here 

[Getting started](Examples/Basics/basics.md)
[Injection](Examples/Injection/injection.md)

### Also...
In the checked out orange folder you will find a *Reference/dist* folder, run the 
*index.html* to take a look at the reference with some handy examples and 
information on how things work.  

## TODO

* Register Orange as an own bower package
* Set Orange as a dependency in bower.json
* Update app/_references.ts with path to bower_components/orange/Reference.d.ts
