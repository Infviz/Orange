# Examples

Here Orange will be explained through examples. The code for all examples discussed here can be found in the *Examples* folder in the root of the repository.

To run the examples run `bower install` in the *Examples* folder, then open a given example via its index.html file. Each example is contained within its own named folder within the *Examples* folder. 

If you want to edit and compile and example, run `tsd install` in the *Examples* folder and recompile a given example by simply running `tsc` from within the folder of the example you wish to compile.
